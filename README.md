# FourNights: C implementation
A program to encrypt all files with certain file extensions in a target directory. Creates a custom key, and sends that key over a socket to a remote server, which sends the key back when properly authenticated. I am not responsible for how this software is used.

## Specifications
<h5>Development Environment</h5>

Note: Program tested only in this environment:

* **Operating System Version**	*Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS trusty* -- (command: ``lsb_release -dirc``)

* **Kernel version** *3.13.0-101-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux*  -- (command: ``uname -pro``)

* **Glibc version** *(Ubuntu EGLIBC 2.19-0ubuntu6.11) 2.19* -- (command: ``ldd --version``)

* **GCC version** *4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3)*

* **OpenSSL** *version 1.0.2l (May 2017)*

* **Python 3** *version 3.4.3*

<h5>Dependencies</h5>
Uses OpenSSL crypto library for bulk file encryption with AES, encryption of a session key with RSA, and transfer over a network with SSL/TLS.

``libcrypto`` and ``libssl`` libraries are included here. Several standard library functions have been recreated and customized.

## Build
``make``

To disable obfuscation functions and macros:
``make OBFUSC=0``

To enable verbose debugging options and disable obfuscation:
``make DEBUG=1``

### Use
``./fournights.0.0.1 <target directory>``

## Program Design

Coming soon

### Repository Structure
| Entry             | Description |
| ------------------| ------------|
| ``file_exts.txt`` | Necessary component for operation of compiled program. NOT GOOD DESIGN
| ``Makefile``      | Compiles + configure program
| ``includes/``     | All headerfiles for this program, and a tar archive with openssl header files
| ``lib/``          | Only Openssl Dynamic Library compiled for Ubuntu
| ``src/``          | All source files
| ``tests/``        | Unit tests
| ``initial_POC/``  | Contains initial python sketches for simple directory traversal and base64 obfuscation with password authentication
| ``TESTS/``        | Not a directory in this repository. Create with ``mkdir TESTS`` and populate with copies of misc. files for a test environment

## Organization
### To Do
#### Resolve Known Bugs
- [ ] {~} Depends on the file ``file_exts.txt``, which has to be formatted in one line, to determine which file extensions to target. OK for an MVP, but this design has some serious limitations.
- [ ] {-} Searches through over 300 file extensions, this could lead to slow searches + inefficient memory management.
- [ ] {-} Uses a recursive function with a lot of variables to walk through all files in a directory. Done this way for MVP. If the target directory has a lot of nested directories, could use up so much memory, it runs out. Use a stack instead?
- [x] En/Decrypts incorrectly when files are > 4KiB
- [x] If run twice in a row, overwrite the old key.
- [x] What if the program hits a file or directory that it has insufficient permissions to do anything with?
- [x] What happens when it hits a very large file and runs out of hard drive space? --> skip file if over 5Gb?
- [x] Remove hard coded filepaths for relative filepaths

#### Base functionality / design considerations
- [ ] { } Encrypt Raw Key Data with RSA
- [ ] { } Reorganize code for legibility -- on going
- [ ] {M} Prepare presentation 
- [ ] {M} Prepare test environments for demonstrations
- [ ] {M} Figure out how to prompt user for decryption authentication
- [ ] {-} Open a socket to send a key (Replaces current functionality where raw key data is saved to a local file)
- [ ] {-} Figure out system design for server
  - [ ] How to listen for keys
  - [ ] How to store keys
  - [ ] How to send back keys
  - [ ] How to listen for proper authentication
- [ ] {-} Case insensitive file extension search
- [ ] {-} Unit Testing

#### Desired Features
- [ ] {!} Implement binary search algorithm for looking through list of target file extensions. Currently, uses linear search for MVP
- [ ] {~} Open a socket to send a key via ping
- [ ] {~} Delivery to clients
- [ ] {-} Portability (Currently only tested on Ubuntu)
  - [ ] Server to send system appropriate binary
- [ ] {-} Figure out how to send key to multiple IP addresses 
- [ ] {-} Generate custom bitcoin addresses and private keys to access the coins
- [ ] {-} Anti-Disassembly
- [ ] {-} Obfuscation
- [ ] {-} Stealth
- [ ] {-} Sandbox detection
